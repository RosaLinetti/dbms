# 🎓 Student Records Database (SQL Project)

## 📌 Overview
This project is a *relational database management system (RDBMS)* built using *MySQL*. This was for my DBMS mini project under 5th sem syllabus. 
It demonstrates:
- Database schema design
- Data insertion
- SQL queries (joins, selection, projection, union, cross product)
- Normalization (Unnormalized → 1NF → 2NF → 3NF)
- Transaction management with commit and rollback

The project  can be expanded further.

# Student Records Database (SQL Project)

## Overview
This project is a *relational database management system (RDBMS)* built using *MySQL*. This was for my DBMS mini project under 5th sem syllabus. 
It demonstrates:
- Database schema design
- Data insertion
- SQL queries (joins, selection, projection, union, cross product)
- Normalization (Unnormalized → 1NF → 2NF → 3NF)
- Transaction management with commit and rollback

The project  can be expanded further.

. Complex queries with INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, FULL OUTER JOIN (via UNION)

. Normalized database design up to Third Normal Form (3NF)
